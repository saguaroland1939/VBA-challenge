# VBA-challenge
The Stock Stats program is intended to be run as a macro within an Excel worksheet.

The program takes an Excel workbook of stock ticker data as input (one year on data per tab) and outputs ticker stats in a formatted table.

The table displays each ticker symbol, its yearly change, its percent yearly change, and its total
stock volume for each year (tab).

Positive change is highlighted in green and negative change in red.

The spreadsheet contains the following fields: ticker symbol, date, opening price, closing price,
and stock volume.

The spreadsheet is assumed to be sorted first by ticker symbol, then sorted
ascending by date so that the data is arranged in 'ticker blocks'.
